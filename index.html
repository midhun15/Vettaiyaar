        <p>Dragoon is the Wind Spirit and is Tyson Granger's Bit-Beast. He takes on the appearance of a large blue dragon and he is indeed the most powerful Bit-Beast ever. He first appeared when Tyson asked for his help. This old dragon came from a sword and he flew right into Tyson's Beyblade. <br> Tyson launched Dragoon a couple of times, but failed trying to summon the Blue Dragon of the East. Tyson also found out that Kai was using Dranzer, the Red Phoenix of Fire. He went home and practiced with Dragoon night and day, not stopping until he mastered his Beyblading skills. After a few tries, Tyson went to fight Kai in an abandoned warehouse and won. Tyson met Max Tate, who helped him customize his Beyblade. After Max's battle with Kai, it was Tyson's turn to fight him. Dragoon and Dranzer met again and fought very ferociously in the tournament, but it ended up in a tie. Dragoon defeated a lot of competitors in the championship. He also defeated the mighty Black Dranzer in Russia with the help of the other Bit-Beast ghosts. Dragoon and Tyson's bond was so strong that Dragoon even defeated Tala Volkov in the finals in Russia, making Tyson the Beyblading World Champion by telling him 'I have returned because you've never given up hope! As long as you believe in me, Tyson, I can do anything!'. Dragoon defeated Tala Valkov's Wolborg. In Beyblade V-Force, Dragoon didn't materialize on Tyson's orders, getting Tyson very frustrated. That's when he found out the answer: Dragoon didn't appear from the Bit-Chip because he detected an invisible Bit-Beast. Dragoon defeated one of the Psykick's Bit-Beasts easily with the Victory Tornado attack. Dragoon then went up against Cyber Dragoon and won after a long fight. Dragoon talked to Tyson once again and he prevailed in beating Flash Leopard. He fought against Zeo and defeated Cerberus.</p>
